1. Run a stopwatch until you stop it
2. Automatically start a countdown for the length of your stopwatch, sending a notification once it gets to 0
3. Repeat

Purpose: To use if I want to work on two things for the same amount of time each, without needing to set the number of minutes each time at the start since that can be interruptive.
